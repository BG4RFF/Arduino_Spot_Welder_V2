The spot welder is made of two boards which are stacked on top of each other. One board contains all the logic and low power electronic components and the other one contains the Mosfets.

The gerber files are made to be used at pcbway.com You can support me by registering through this link http://www.pcbway.com/setinvite.aspx?inviteid=12824 This way you get a 5$ coupon for your order and i get some percent discount at the shop for upcoming projects.

As the Gerber File you can use the Spot_Welder_V2_Gerber.zip which has both boards combined to one big board. You have to cut this in half at home to get the two single boards.

To download the files please download the complete project by clicking on the "clone or download" button on the projects main page (https://github.com/KaeptnBalu/Arduino_Spot_Welder_V2) Downloading by right click and "save as" does seem to cause problems.
